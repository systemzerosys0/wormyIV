# wormyIV
A basic worm written in python. My first attempt at writing malware. 

This code is written for educational purposes only. I do not support the usage of files like this, or any malware, for any kind of malicious internet activity. 
We're all internet citizens, please be respectful of the people you share this beautiful beautiful online space with. 

The function of this worm is to browse through every directory and all directories therein recursively to find the 
absolute path to each file. Afterwards, each file will be replaced with the code for this worm. 

Usage
=========
1) ./wormyIVv1.0.py (absolute file path to starting directory)
